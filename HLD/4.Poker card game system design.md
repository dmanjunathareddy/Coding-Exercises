Game Logic: Handles user interactions, validates moves, and communicates with the server.
Server-side (Backend):

Game Engine: Manages the game state, rules, and logic.
User Management: Handles user authentication, registration, and profile management.
WebSocket Server: Facilitates real-time communication between the server and clients.
Database: Stores user data, game history, and other relevant information.
Game Logic:

Deck Management: Generates and manages the deck of cards.
Player Actions: Processes player actions such as betting, folding, checking, and revealing cards.
Winning Logic: Determines the winner(s) based on hand rankings and rules.
Communication:

WebSocket Protocol: Enables real-time bidirectional communication between the server and clients.
RESTful APIs: Provides endpoints for actions like joining a game, making bets, and fetching game state.


System Workflow:

   User Registration and Authentication:

Users register and log in to the platform.
Authentication tokens are generated and used for subsequent requests.
Lobby:

Players can join/create game rooms.
Lobby displays available games, room details, and player statuses.
Game Initialization:

Players in a room are assigned seats.
The game engine initializes a new round, shuffles the deck, and deals cards.
Game Rounds:

Players take turns based on the game rules (betting, checking, folding).
The server updates the game state and broadcasts changes to all players.
Card Revealing:

At the end of the round, reveal cards and determine the winner.
Update player balances based on the outcome.
Game Conclusion:

Display results and allow players to start a new round.
Update player statistics and game history.
Real-time Updates:

Use WebSocket to push real-time updates to all players (e.g., new player joined, someone made a bet).
User Interaction:

Allow players to chat, emote, and perform in-game actions.


Technologies:

Frontend: HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, React or Angular for UI, WebSocket for real-time communication.
Backend: Node.js or Java with Spring Boot, WebSocket server (e.g., Socket.IO), RESTful APIs, Database (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB).
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure and stateless authentication.
Game Logic: Implement game rules and logic using an object-oriented approach.
Scalability: Deploy on cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) for scalability.
