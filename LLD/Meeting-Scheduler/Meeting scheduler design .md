System Workflow:

   Meeting Request:

The user submits a meeting request, including details such as meeting participants, preferred date, and time.
Availability Check:

If a suitable room is available, proceed to the next step. Otherwise, notify the user that no room is available.
Booking the Meeting:

The MeetingScheduler books the selected meeting room for the specified date and time.
If the booking is successful, the MeetingScheduler proceeds to the next step. Otherwise, notify the user of the failure.
Notification to Participants:

The NotificationService sends notifications to all meeting participants.
Notifications can be sent via email, SMS, or any other specified channels.
Meeting Execution:

The scheduled meeting takes place in the booked meeting room at the specified date and time.
Meeting Completion:

After the meeting, the MeetingScheduler may provide an option to mark the meeting as completed or handle this automatically based on the scheduled end time.
Room Unbooking (Optional):

If required, the MeetingScheduler unbooks the meeting room after the meeting is completed or at a specified time.
